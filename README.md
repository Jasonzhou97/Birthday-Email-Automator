You can search through thr csv file by typing in the person's name and pressing "search" button, his birthday will be shown if you have added his data.
This program can be run on a cloud server eg pythonanywhere so that it can be executed everyday automatically to check if the current days date matches any of the birthday dates you added. If it does, an email will be sent from your email to the person's email.
